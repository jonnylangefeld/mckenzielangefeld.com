I currently teach private piano, percussion, and drum set lessons to over 20 musicians in the Bay Area. 
Even a pandemic didn't keep my students and I from having a successful year of progress in our music making. Read more in my [blog post here](/blog/connecting-through-music-during-a-not-so-average-year).

I was on faculty at the CODA Mountain Music Festival in West Virginia in the summers of 2017 and 2018, teaching the percussionists as well as the beginning pianists.

I was on faculty at the Stanford Youth Orchestra summer program in the summer of 2015, teaching private percussion lessons and coaching the orchestral percussion sectionals.

I had a six week residency in Montreal, QC, Canada, where I worked with Giant Steps School's students on the autism spectrum to perform a school-wide percussion solo and ensemble concert.

I taught twenty piano students for Marin Music Conservatory through the Mill Valley Enrichment Program from 2013-2015 at Tam Valley School and Old Mill School in Mill Valley, CA.

For two years, I coached percussion students weekly at Presidio Middle School and Everett Middle School in San Francisco through SFCM's [Conservatory in the Schools](http://www.sfcm.edu/conservatory-in-the-schools) program. I helped lead the percussion ensemble at Presidio Middle School to receive a command performance at the CMEA Solo/Ensemble Festival in 2014.

While at Eastman School of Music, I participated in the [Pathways to Music](http://www.esm.rochester.edu/community/pathways/) mentoring program in 2009, mentoring and coaching a young percussion student in the Rochester School District.

I coached the percussion ensemble, percussion sectionals, and taught private lessons to beginning, intermediate, and advanced band percussion students at the Stockdale Christian School Summer Band Camp for two summers in 2003 and 2004.
